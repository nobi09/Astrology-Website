    <h2>Pablo Picasso</h2>
    <p>Summary of Pablo Picasso
        Pablo Picasso was the most dominant and influential artist of the first half of the 20th century. Associated most of all with pioneering <a href="">Cubism</a>, alongside <a href="">Georges Braque</a>, he also invented collage and made major contributions to <a href="">Symbolism</a> and <a href="">Surrealism</a>. He saw himself above all as a painter, yet his sculpture was greatly influential, and he also explored areas as diverse as printmaking and ceramics. Finally, he was a famously charismatic personality; his many relationships with women not only filtered into his art but also may have directed its course, and his behavior has come to embody that of the bohemian modern artist in the popular imagination.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>      It was a confluence of influences - from <a href="">Paul Cézanne</a> and <a href="">Henri Rousseau</a>, to archaic and tribal art - that encouraged Picasso to lend his figures more structure and ultimately set him on the path towards Cubism, in which he deconstructed the conventions of perspective that had dominated painting since the Renaissance. These innovations would have far-reaching consequences for practically all of modern art, revolutionizing attitudes to the depiction of form in space.
</p>
      
      
      <p>Picasso's immersion in Cubism also eventually led him to the invention of collage, in which he abandoned the idea of the picture as a window on objects in the world, and began to conceive of it merely as an arrangement of signs that used different, sometimes metaphorical means, to refer to those objects. This too would prove hugely influential for decades to come.
</p>
      
      
      <p>Picasso had an eclectic attitude to style, and although, at any one time, his work was usually characterized by a single dominant approach, he often moved interchangeably between different styles - sometimes even in the same artwork.
</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>His encounter with <a href="">Surrealism</a>, although never transforming his work entirely, encouraged not only the soft forms and tender eroticism of portraits of his mistress Marie-Therese Walter, but also the starkly angular imagery of <a href="">Guernica (1937)</a>, the century's most famous anti-war painting.
</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Picasso was always eager to place himself in history, and some of his greatest works, such as Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), refer to a wealth of past precedents - even while overturning them. As he matured he became only more conscious of assuring his legacy, and his late work is characterized by a frank dialogue with Old Masters such as <a href="">Ingres</a>, <a href="">Velazquez</a>, <a href="">Goya</a>, and <a href="">Rembrandt</a>.
